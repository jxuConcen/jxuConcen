# Jun Xu here 👋

I'm a front-end developer passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and building sustainable web experiences that are both performant and environmentally conscious.

## What I Do

I craft user interfaces that prioritize performance, accessibility, and minimal environmental impact. My work focuses on creating efficient, well-structured codebases that are easy to maintain and scale.

**Core Technologies:**
- JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript
- React, Next.js, Vue.js
- HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Tailwind CSS
- Git, Webpack, Vite

## My Approach

**Clean Code:** I believe in writing code that speaks for itself—clear naming conventions, proper documentation, and adherence to best practices. Code reviews and refactoring are essential parts of my development process.

**Sustainability:** Every line of code has a carbon footprint. I'm committed to building lightweight, optimized applications that reduce energy consumption through efficient rendering, smart caching strategies, and thoughtful asset optimization.

**Continuous Learning:** The web evolves quickly, and so do I. I stay current with industry trends while maintaining a critical eye for what truly improves user experience and code quality.

## Current Focus

- Building accessible, performant web applications
- Reducing bundle sizes and optimizing Core Web Vitals
- Exploring sustainable web design patterns
- Contributing to open-source projects that align with my values
